# Hands-on Cloudfront : Configuring Cloudfront with Route53, ACM and S3 as Static Website


## Step 1: Upload your content to Amazon S3 and grant object permissions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

An Amazon S3 bucket is a container for files (objects) or folders. CloudFront can distribute almost any type of file for you using an Amazon S3 bucket as the source. For example, CloudFront can distribute
text, images, and videos. There is no maximum for the amount of data that you can store on Amazon S3.

By default, your Amazon S3 bucket and all the files in it are private—only the AWS account that created the bucket has permission to read or write the files. If you want to allow anyone to access the files
in your Amazon S3 bucket using CloudFront URLs, you must grant public read permissions to the objects.

**To upload your content to Amazon S3 and grant read permissions to everyone**

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at  [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).

2.  Choose **Create bucket**.

3.  For **Bucket name**, enter a bucket name. <`domainname isminiz`>

    Important

    For your bucket to work with CloudFront, the name must conform to  DNS naming requirements. For more information, see [Bucket restrictions and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*.

4.  For **Region**, choose an AWS Region for your bucket. We recommend that you choose a Region close to you to optimize latency and  minimize costs, or you might choose another Region to address
    regulatory requirements.

5.  In the **Block Public Access settings for bucket** section, clear  the check box for **Block *all* public access**.

    You must allow public read access to the bucket and files so that  CloudFront URLs can serve content from the bucket. However, you can  restrict access to specific content by using the CloudFront private
    content feature. For more information, see [Serving private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html).

    Select the check box for **I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.**.

6.  Leave all other settings at their defaults, and then choose **Create bucket**.

7.  (Optional) If you don’t have your own website content, or if you just want to experiment with CloudFront before uploading your own content, use the following link to download a simple *hello world* webpage:
    
8.  In the **Buckets** section, choose your new bucket, and then choose **Upload**.

9.  Use the **Upload** page to add your content to the S3 bucket. If you  downloaded the simple *hello world* webpage, add the `index.html`  file and the `css` folder (with the `style.css` file inside it).

10. `Properties > Static Website Hosting > Enabled > Index Document: index.html(Geri kalan seyler default) > Save Changes`

11. Static Website Hosting'in en altindaki isme tikla.

12. `PErmissions > Bucket Policy > Edit > Policy Generator `

```txt
Select Type Policy: S3 Bucket Policy
Principal: *
Actions: GetObject
ARN: Edit Bucket Policy sayfasindan Bucket ARN yi kopyala ve yapistir; sonuna /* ekleyelim ki / un altindaki butun dosyalari baglasin.
Add statement
Generate policy
```
- Sonrasinda policy'yi kopyala ve Edit Bucket Policydeki policy'yi silip yerine yapistir.
- `Permission overview: Public` olsun.
- Siteye S3 Endpointten bak ve gor.
-----------------------------------------

## Cloudfronttan Sertifika Alma

- Arama tusuna `Certificate Manager` yaz.

```txt
Request
Request a Public Certificate
    Fully qualified domain name: <domainismin>
                                *<domainismin>

Request

Certificate ID: ansdjkanjkdnaskd   Status: Pending validation
    Certificate ID ye tiklayalim
        Create Records in Route 53
```

## Step 2: Create a CloudFront distribution.
----------------------------------------

**To create a CloudFront distribution**

1.  Open the CloudFront console at  [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home)
    .
2.  Choose **Create Distribution**, and then choose **Get Started**.

3.  `Origin Domain: HTTP KISIMLARI SILINMIS OLARAK <S3 Bucket'in Endpoint'i>`

4.  `Settings > Alternate Domain Name(CName) > Add Item > <domainnameininismi>`

5.  `Custom SSL certificate > Choose a Certificate > domaininin \* siz versiyonunu sec`

6. `Create Distribution`. Biraz zaman alabilir `Last modified = Deploying` ten `Deployed` olana kadar bekle. Sonrasinda `General > Details > Distribution domain name` Domain Name'in uzerinden cache'lemeyle s3 e erisebilirsin 
7. Domain Name'i tarayiciya yapistir ve sertifikayi gor. Kilit sekmesine tikla, Security > Certificate is Valid(e tikla)

## Websitesindeki DEgisiklik

- html dosyasiyla oyna ve guncel html dosyasini S3'e yukle. s3 endpointinde guncelleme gorunuyor ancak domain name'inde veya cloudfrontta guncelleme yok. `Invalidations > Create Invalidations> Add object paths > /index.html veya /* > Create` Bu olmazsa 24 saat sonra gelir.

- `Cloudfront > Distributions > Geo Distributions > Block<herkes kendi ulkesini bloklasin>` dersek ulke bazli bloklariz.
